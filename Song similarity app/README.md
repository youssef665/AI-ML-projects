# Song Similarity Project
This project aims to identify the similarity between songs by utilizing preprocessing, vectorization, and cosine similarity techniques. The project also includes a Flask server to serve the predictive model as a web application.<br>

### Description
The project involves the following key steps and components:

### Data Preprocessing:<br>
The song data is cleaned and prepared using SpaCy, a powerful NLP library. SpaCy is used to perform tasks such as tokenization, lemmatization, and removal of stop words. This step ensures the text data is in a suitable format for analysis and free from any noise that could affect the accuracy of the similarity predictions.<br>

### Vectorization:<br>
The cleaned song data is converted into numerical vectors using the SentenceTransformer model. This model transforms text-based features of songs into a numerical format that can be quantitatively analyzed.<br>

### Cosine Similarity Calculation:<br>
The vectorized song data is then analyzed using cosine similarity. Cosine similarity measures the similarity between two non-zero vectors of an inner product space by measuring the cosine of the angle between them. This method is particularly effective for text data, as it provides a robust metric for determining the similarity between songs based on their lyrical content.<br>

### Web Application:<br>
A Flask server is used to serve the predictive model as a web application. This allows users to input song lyrics and get the predicted similarity in real-time.<br>

### Libraries and Tools Used:<br>
Numpy: For numerical operations and handling arrays.<br>
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.<br>
SpaCy: For preprocessing text data, including tokenization, lemmatization, and stop word removal.<br>
SentenceTransformer: For converting song lyrics into numerical vectors.<br>
Scikit-learn: Specifically, the cosine_similarity function to compute similarity scores.<br>
OS: For handling file operations.<br>
Flask: For creating the web application.<br>
By following these steps, the project is able to predict song similarity, which can be used for various applications such as music recommendation systems, playlist generation, and music analysis.<br>

This project demonstrates an effective approach to quantifying song similarity using machine learning and natural language processing techniques, making it possible to recommend songs that are similar in their lyrical content.<br>
